## Summary Of Dataset Imported

This particular DataSet has been taken from Kaggel Dataset Website.Where the care has been taken to ensure that the data has a mix of quantitative and qualitative(categorical) variables.

The variables in the dataset are defined as follows:

WI = weekly wage income in rupees

Age = age in years

Dsex = 1 for male workers and 0 for female workers

DE2 = a dummy variable taking a value of 1 for workers with up to a primary education

DE3 = a dummy variable taking a value of 1 for workers with up to a secondary education

DE4 = a dummy variable taking a value of 1 for workers with higher education

DPT = a dummy variable taking a value of 1 for workers with permanent jobs and a value of 0 for temporary workers


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(readxl)
IndianLabor90 <- read_excel("IndianLabor90.xlsx")
View(IndianLabor90)


```

```{r}

cat("Summary Statistics for Daily Wages and Age of Workers:\n")
print(summary(IndianLabor90$WI))
print(summary(IndianLabor90$AGE))

```
```{r}
cat("Summary Statistics for Categorical Variable SEX and Higher Education:\n")
print(table(IndianLabor90$DSEX))
print(table(IndianLabor90$DE4))
```
```{r}
#transforming the a variable WI to increasing 10 numerical vale
IndianLabor90$WI <- IndianLabor90$WI + 10
IndianLabor90
```

```{r}
hist(IndianLabor90$AGE,main = "Histogram of Workers Age",xlab = "AGE")
```
```{r}
plot(IndianLabor90$AGE,IndianLabor90$DE2, main = "Scatter Plot - AGE Vs Primary Education", xlab = "AGE", ylab = "Primary Education")
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
